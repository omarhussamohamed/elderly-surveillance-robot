# Sensors and Actuators Configuration for Elderly Bot
# ====================================================
# This file contains parameters for the MQ-6 gas sensor, active buzzer, and Jetson monitoring.
#
# SAFETY: All features are DISABLED by default until hardware is connected and tested.
# To enable a feature:
#   1. Install required dependencies (see scripts/sensors_actuators_node.py)
#   2. Connect and test hardware
#   3. Set enable_xxx parameter to true
#   4. Launch with sensors_actuators:=true

# ===== FEATURE ENABLE FLAGS =====
# Set to true only after hardware is connected and tested

enable_gas_sensor: true    # MQ-6 gas sensor (GPIO or I2C mode) - ENABLED FOR TESTING
enable_buzzer: true         # Active buzzer via GPIO - ENABLED FOR TESTING
enable_stats: true          # Jetson temp/power (safe without hardware)

# ===== GAS SENSOR (MQ-6) =====
# Two modes available:
#   - 'gpio': D0 pin → Jetson GPIO (binary detection, no ADC needed) ✓ RECOMMENDED
#   - 'i2c':  A0 pin → ADS1115 ADC → I2C (analog voltage, requires ADS1115)

gas_sensor_mode: "gpio"  # "gpio" or "i2c"

# --- GPIO MODE SETTINGS ---
# GPIO pin for D0 digital output (BOARD numbering)
# Default: Pin 24 (GPIO 8)
# See docs/GAS_SENSOR_WIRING.md for wiring diagram
gas_sensor_gpio_pin: 24

# --- I2C MODE SETTINGS (only used if gas_sensor_mode="i2c") ---
# Voltage threshold for gas detection (volts)
# MQ-6 typical: Clean air ~0.4-0.6V, gas present >1.0V
gas_threshold_voltage: 1.0

# ADS1115 I2C settings
adc_i2c_address: 0x48  # Check with: i2cdetect -y -r 1
adc_i2c_bus: 1         # I2C bus number (usually 1 on Jetson)
adc_channel: 0         # ADC channel (A0=0, A1=1, A2=2, A3=3)
adc_gain: 1            # Gain: 1=±4.096V (suitable for 0-5V sensors)

# ===== BUZZER =====
# Hardware: Active buzzer module → 2N2222 transistor → Jetson GPIO
# Circuit: Pin 16 → 1kΩ resistor → 2N2222 Base, Emitter → GND, Collector → Buzzer (-)
# See: docs/BUZZER_WIRING.md

# GPIO pin number (BOARD numbering)
# Pin 16 = GPIO 23 (controls transistor base)
buzzer_pin: 16  # Currently connected and enabled

# ===== PUBLISHING RATE =====
# How often to publish sensor data (Hz)
publish_rate: 1.0  # 1 Hz = once per second (adjust as needed)

# ===== CALIBRATION NOTES =====
# Gas Sensor Calibration (PPM conversion):
#   1. Measure voltage in clean air (baseline)
#   2. Expose to known gas concentration
#   3. Calculate Rs/R0 ratio
#   4. Use MQ-6 datasheet curve to convert to PPM
#   5. Implement conversion in node or separate calibration node
#
# Buzzer Timeout:
#   Buzzer auto-shutoff after 5 seconds without command (safety feature)
#   This is hardcoded in the node, adjust there if needed
