# Sensors and Actuators Configuration for Elderly Bot
# ====================================================
# This file contains parameters for the MQ-6 gas sensor, active buzzer, and Jetson monitoring.
#
# SAFETY: All features are DISABLED by default until hardware is connected and tested.
# To enable a feature:
#   1. Install required dependencies (see scripts/sensors_actuators_node.py)
#   2. Connect and test hardware
#   3. Set enable_xxx parameter to true
#   4. Launch with sensors_actuators:=true

sensors_actuators_node:
  # ===== FEATURE ENABLE FLAGS =====
  # Set to true only after hardware is connected and tested
  
  enable_gas_sensor: false   # MQ-6 via ADS1115 I2C ADC
  enable_buzzer: false        # Active buzzer via GPIO
  enable_stats: true          # Jetson temp/power (safe without hardware)
  
  # ===== GAS SENSOR (MQ-6 via ADS1115) =====
  # Hardware: MQ-6 LPG/Propane sensor → ADS1115 16-bit ADC → Jetson I2C
  
  # Voltage threshold for gas detection (volts)
  # MQ-6 typical: Clean air ~0.4-0.6V, gas present >1.0V
  # Adjust based on your sensor calibration
  gas_threshold_voltage: 1.0
  
  # ADS1115 I2C address (default 0x48, can be 0x49/0x4A/0x4B)
  # Check with: i2cdetect -y -r 1
  adc_i2c_address: 0x48
  
  # ADC channel for gas sensor (A0=0, A1=1, A2=2, A3=3)
  adc_channel: 0
  
  # ADC gain setting (1 = ±4.096V range, suitable for 3.3V sensors)
  # Options: 2/3=±6.144V, 1=±4.096V, 2=±2.048V, 4=±1.024V, 8=±0.512V, 16=±0.256V
  adc_gain: 1
  
  # ===== BUZZER =====
  # Hardware: Active buzzer module → Jetson GPIO pin (BOARD numbering)
  # Common pins: 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40
  
  # GPIO pin number (BOARD numbering, 0 = disabled)
  # Example: Pin 12 = GPIO18
  # Check pinout: https://jetsonhacks.com/nvidia-jetson-nano-j41-header-pinout/
  buzzer_pin: 0  # SET TO YOUR CHOSEN PIN (e.g., 12) when hardware ready
  
  # ===== PUBLISHING RATE =====
  # How often to publish sensor data (Hz)
  publish_rate: 1.0  # 1 Hz = once per second (adjust as needed)
  
  # ===== CALIBRATION NOTES =====
  # Gas Sensor Calibration (PPM conversion):
  #   1. Measure voltage in clean air (baseline)
  #   2. Expose to known gas concentration
  #   3. Calculate Rs/R0 ratio
  #   4. Use MQ-6 datasheet curve to convert to PPM
  #   5. Implement conversion in node or separate calibration node
  #
  # Buzzer Timeout:
  #   Buzzer auto-shutoff after 5 seconds without command (safety feature)
  #   This is hardcoded in the node, adjust there if needed
