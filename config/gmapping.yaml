# GMapping SLAM Configuration
# Optimized for indoor 4WD robot with RPLidar A1

# ========== FRAME IDs ==========
base_frame: base_footprint
map_frame: map
odom_frame: odom

# ========== TRANSFORM ==========
# Time tolerance for TF lookups
transform_publish_period: 0.05

# ========== MAP PARAMETERS ==========
# Map resolution (meters per cell)
# STABILITY FIX: Increased from 2.0 to 3.0 for CPU relief (visualization only, not internal mapping)
map_update_interval: 3.0

# Maximum range of laser (RPLidar A1: ~12m, but accuracy degrades >6m)
# LASER MODEL FIX: Reduced maxUrange from 9.5m to 6.0m
# RPLidar accuracy: <3m = ±3cm, 3-6m = ±5cm, >6m = ±10-20cm (UNUSABLE)
# Indoor environments typically <5m → 6m provides margin without noisy far points
maxRange: 8.0  # Sensor physical max (for obstacle detection)
maxUrange: 6.0  # Use only accurate points <6m for mapping (CRITICAL FIX)

# Minimum range (RPLidar blind spot)
minRange: 0.15  # 15cm minimum (avoid chassis reflections)

# Map size and resolution
xmin: -50.0
ymin: -50.0
xmax: 50.0
ymax: 50.0
# LASER MODEL FIX: Reduced from 0.02m to 0.015m (1.5cm) for sharper walls
# With likelihood_field model's noise tolerance, we can use finer resolution
delta: 0.015  # 1.5cm resolution (sharper single-pixel walls, ~10KB extra memory)

# ========== LASER PARAMETERS ==========
# Number of beams to skip in each scan (for computational efficiency)
# RPLidar A1 produces ~360 points, skip every other one
throttle_scans: 1

# ========== LASER MODEL (CRITICAL FOR SCAN MATCHING) ==========
# LASER MODEL FIX: Use likelihood_field (robust to noise) instead of beam (default)
# Beam model: Physically accurate but INTOLERANT to RPLidar reflections/noise
# Likelihood_field: Probabilistic correlation, ROBUST to sensor errors
laser_model_type: likelihood_field  # CRITICAL: Must be set explicitly!

# Laser noise/error tolerance for likelihood_field model
# RPLidar A1: ±2-5cm accuracy → need 10cm tolerance for noise robustness
laser_sigma_hit: 0.1  # 10cm std dev (handles RPLidar noise + wall thickness)
laser_lambda_short: 0.1  # Short reading weight (obstacles closer than expected)
laser_z_hit: 0.95  # Weight for correct readings (high confidence in good points)
laser_z_short: 0.05  # Weight for short readings (low - mostly correct)
laser_z_max: 0.05  # Weight for max-range readings (RPLidar artifacts)
laser_z_rand: 0.05  # Weight for random readings (reflections, dust)

# Likelihood field correlation parameters
laser_likelihood_max_dist: 2.0  # Max distance for likelihood correlation (meters)
# Limits search space for faster scan matching

# Beam subsampling (reduce computational load)
laser_max_beams: 180  # Use 180 beams (subsample 360→180 for 50% CPU reduction)
# Still provides 2° angular resolution (sufficient for 2cm map)

# Scan matching optimization parameters
sigma: 0.05  # Increased from 0.02 for noise tolerance with likelihood model
kernelSize: 1  # Gaussian kernel for map smoothing (1=no smoothing, sharper walls)
lstep: 0.05  # Linear search step (5cm)
astep: 0.05  # Angular search step (~3°)
iterations: 5  # Scan matcher iterations (keep at 5 for likelihood model accuracy)
lsigma: 0.075  # Laser likelihood sigma for correlation
ogain: 3.0  # Gain for updating occupancy grid (higher=faster convergence)
lskip: 0  # Laser skip (0=use all selected beams)

# ========== MOTION MODEL ==========
# Odometry error parameters for skid-steer robot
# These are critical for accurate mapping with wheel slip
# INCREASED from optimistic values to reflect 4WD skid-steer reality

# Linear movement error
srr: 0.05   # Linear -> Linear (was 0.01, increased for wheel slip)
srt: 0.15   # Linear -> Angular (INCREASED for stronger cross-coupling during turns)

# Angular movement error - CRITICAL FOR ROTATION
# Pure rotation on skid-steer has EXTREME slip (all 4 wheels sliding laterally)
str: 0.15   # Angular -> Linear (INCREASED - rotation causes severe lateral slip)
stt: 0.25   # Angular -> Angular (INCREASED 2.5× - rotation odometry extremely unreliable)

# ========== PARTICLE FILTER ==========
# Number of particles in the filter
# STABILITY FIX: Reduced from 1000 to 500 for Jetson Nano CPU performance
# With reduced process noise + improved odometry, 500 particles provide sufficient diversity
particles: 500

# Resampling thresholds
# STABILITY FIX: Reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 to resample less frequently
# Prevents excessive resampling with noisy odometry, maintains particle diversity
resampleThreshold: 0.3

# ========== LIKELIHOOD ==========
# Likelihood sampling parameters
llsamplerange: 0.01
llsamplestep: 0.01
lasamplerange: 0.005
lasamplestep: 0.005

# ========== SCAN MATCHING ==========
# Minimum score for accepting a scan match (balanced for reliable matching)
# GHOSTING FIX: Increased from 50 to 100 to REJECT false loop closures in small rooms
# Small rectangular rooms have repetitive features (4 identical walls + corners)
# Low minimumScore causes false matches → pose jumps → wall duplication
# Trade-off: May reject valid scans in very plain areas, but prevents catastrophic ghosting
minimumScore: 100

# Linear and angular search range for scan matching
# GHOSTING FIX: Reduced linearUpdate to 0.05m to UPDATE MORE FREQUENTLY
# More frequent updates = less pose uncertainty = smaller search space = prevents false matches
# At 0.1m/s speed: updates every 0.5sec (was 1.0sec at 0.1m)
linearUpdate: 0.05   # Update every 5cm (DOUBLED update frequency to prevent drift accumulation)
angularUpdate: 0.05  # Update every 2.9° rotation (unchanged)

# Temporal update
# STABILITY FIX: Enabled with 1.0 sec as safety fallback for edge cases (slow spin, vibration)
temporalUpdate: 1.0  # Force update every 1 second regardless of distance traveled

# ========== OPTIMIZATION ==========
# Number of iterations for scan matching optimization
# STABILITY FIX: Reduced from 5 to 3 for 40% faster scan matching (sufficient for delta=0.02)
optIterations: 3

# ========== INITIAL POSE ==========
# Initial map size
xmin: -10.0
ymin: -10.0
xmax: 10.0
ymax: 10.0

# ========== OUTPUT ==========
# Occupancy threshold
occ_thresh: 0.25

# Map update interval (redundant declaration - primary is at line 17)
map_update_interval: 3.0
