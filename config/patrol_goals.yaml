# Patrol Goals Configuration
#
# This file defines the waypoints for autonomous patrol.
# The robot will visit these locations in sequence and loop indefinitely.
#
# Each goal consists of:
#   name: Descriptive name for the location
#   x: X coordinate in map frame (meters)
#   y: Y coordinate in map frame (meters)
#   yaw: Orientation in radians (0 = facing +X axis)
#
# To create your own patrol goals:
# 1. Launch navigation: roslaunch elderly_bot navigation.launch
# 2. In RViz, use "2D Pose Estimate" to move the robot around
# 3. Note the coordinates from /amcl_pose topic or RViz
# 4. Update this file with your desired waypoints
#
# Coordinate system (REP-103):
#   X: Forward
#   Y: Left
#   Yaw: Counter-clockwise rotation from +X axis

# Notes:
# - Coordinates are examples and must be adjusted for your specific map
# - Use RViz to determine actual coordinates after mapping
# - Ensure goals are in accessible areas (not inside walls or furniture)
# - The robot will attempt to reach each goal with the specified orientation
# - Failed goals will be retried (see patrol_client.py parameters)
